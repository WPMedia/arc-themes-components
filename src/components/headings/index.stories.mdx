# Headings

A set of components (`<Heading>` and `<HeadingSection>`) to allow control of headings to maintain their hierarchy within a page. Used together, the Themes Components are accessible if they are used together. Properly ordered headings make it easier for people using assistive technologies to navigate and comprehend the content.

Headings (`<h1>` -> `<h6>`) are not to be used to achieve styling goals. They are to be used to provide semantic meaning and structure to a web page. Heading level maxes out at level 6.

Headings should always:

- be used in order
- never skip levels when inceasing in numeric value

Always use the `<Heading>` component in a block that you wish to make an HTML heading. The component will use the correct heading element from 1 to 6 depending on location.

By default, this will output as `<h1>` if used on its own within a page. To ensure corrent hierarchy, please use `<HeadingSection>`.

The `<HeadingSection>` component should be used to wrap all `<Heading>` components that should not be the page title. The `<HeadingSection>` component will increase the heading element value each time it is used. If you are making a feature that has a heading to be output as a title for a group of stories, then using the `<HeadingSection>` will increase the `<Heading>` items for you providing you correct hierarchy output of headings.

In addition, the `<Heading>` component is customizable because custom classes can be passed in via the `className` prop which we will append to a class name we already provide for the Heading.

## Usage

By default, the Link component is secure and accessible. The link is for enclosing all contents with a link. There are security considerations made here by opting into using "rel=noreferrer" when opening the link in a new tab. In terms of accessibility, there is visually hidden text indicating to the user of the link behavior.

In addition, the Link component is customizable. That accessible text can be customized or translated by passing in a prop `openNewTabLinkVisuallyHiddenText`.

By default, the link will open in a new tab if the `href` property starts with http or https. Yet this can be overridden with the `opensInNewTab` prop.

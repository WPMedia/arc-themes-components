# Conditional

A component used for conditionally rendering a wrapping component.  If the Condition is met, the component specified will be rendered with the children provided therein.  If the condition is not met, only the children will be rendered.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Conditional } from "@wpmedia/arc-themes-components";

const Feature = () => (
	<Conditional component={Link} condition={true}>
		Component Children
	</Conditional>
);
```

## Properties

<ArgsTable of={Conditional} />

## Stories

** Conditional **

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Conditional">
		<Stack>
			<Conditional component={Link} condition={"aa" === "aa"} href="/" openInNewTab>
				Condition is truthy so outputs using `component` property
			</Conditional>
			<Conditional component={Link} condition={"aa" === "ab"} href="/">
				Will render children only as condition is false
			</Conditional>
		</Stack>
	</Story>
</Canvas>

# Caption

The `<Caption>` component is used to display a caption for its parent element. This is using the [`<figcaption>` HTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/figcaption).

The component can take in HTML to render `title`, `caption`, and `credit`.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Caption } from "@wpmedia/arc-themes-components";

const CaptionFeature = () => (
	<figure>
		<img src="/man-bites-dog" alt="Man biting dog" />
		<Caption
			title="Important Alert"
			caption="<div>There is man on the loose biting dogs</div><div>All dogs should evacuate the area</div>"
			credit={{ by: [{ name: "John Doe" }], affiliation: [{ name: "Stock Photo" }] }}
		/>
	</figure>
);
```

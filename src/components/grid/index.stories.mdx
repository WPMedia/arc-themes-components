# Grid

The `<Grid>` component is an wrapper to the CSS Grid layout in order for Themes to
be able to control two-dimensional grid layout's within blocks.

## as

The `Grid` will default to use the HTML `div` element for rendering. There will be times
where the `Grid` will be used for sectioning and the `div` element does not provide semantic
meaning, to avoid having to use additional markup to bring back semantics use the `as` prop to
render the `Grid` as a different HTML element. By using the `as` property you are then required
to ensure all the correct attributes for a given tag are still passed through.

**Note:** The `as` prop's primary use case if for sectioning. There is likely a component
better suited for your needs. For example: `Link` component should be used for anchor's.

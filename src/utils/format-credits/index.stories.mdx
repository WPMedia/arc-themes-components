# Format Credits

The `formatCredits()` function takes in an object with keys of `by` and `affiliation`. The function outputs a comma-separated list based off of the `name` key within the previously-mentioned keys. This follows the [ANS schema](https://github.com/washingtonpost/ans-schema) for credits.

## Usage

```jsx
import formatCredits from "./formatCredits";

const credits = {
	by: [
		{
			name: "John Doe",
		},
		{
			name: "Jane Doe",
		},
	],
	affiliation: [{ name: "Stock Photo" }],
};

const formattedCredits = formatCredits(credits);
```
